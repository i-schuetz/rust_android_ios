# Android / iOS app with shared Rust logic

![logos](img/logos_.png)

This is an example that shows how to communicate with a shared Rust library from an Android and iOS app. The idea is to be able to share domain logic & most services (networking, database, bluetooth, etc.) using Rust and use the native SDKs for presentation and platform specific services.

# Why?

This approach gives us the best of all worlds! We prevent code duplication by using a shared library. Rust, as a highly performant and safe language is a great fit for mobile. We keep a fully native UI experience and uncomplicated access to the latest APIs of the platforms. 

It's also very flexible, allowing to migrate easily between different platforms, including conventional cross-platform frameworks like Flutter or React Native. So for example, you can develop your MVP with Rust+React Native or Rust+Fluter, and migrate later to native iOS/Android, without having to rewrite everything. You even can reuse your core for a web-app, using WebAssembly, and any possible future latest and greatest framework.

# What do I put in Rust?

Everything that's not platform dependent: domain logic, networking, database...

# How do I build modern apps with this?

You probably are wondering how to use Rust with reactive capabilities (RxJava, Combine, reactive database, etc). The answer is that you don't have to manage rx/async in Rust at all (unless e.g. parallelizing computation intensive tasks). The idea that you've to spawn a thread for or put each networking call or database access in an observable, littering your core business logic and services with async flows, is pretty much an anti-pattern (see e.g. this talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsavoQWAVqM). If you move rx/async near to the UI (where it's needed, to not block the UI thread), the core becomes simpler and easily composable, and you don't have to worry about reactive frameworks in Rust. See real world example below, which implements this pattern: The apps use respectively RxJava and RxSwift, but the Rust core is mostly synchronous (except one place where we need to parallelize a computation intensive task).

# Is this a good fit for my app?

If your app is a thin frontend for a REST api (i.e. the "core" is intended to be simple networking calls), or otherwise UI/platform services -centric, probably it's not worth it. The build flows and maintaining the FFI/JNI interfaces obviously add some complexity to the development process and a new required skillset. If you're in a big company that has plenty of iOS and Android developers, who aren't interested in Rust and don't mind implementing everything 2x, it's probably also not worth it ðŸ™‚ 

For everything else I'd say it's at least worth trying out!

# Demo examples

#### âœ… Functions
Calls Rust functions from Android / iOS, shows returned vale in UI.

#### âœ… Callback
Passes callback to Rust, update UI from callback with result.

# Real world example

Checkout https://github.com/Co-Epi/app-backend-rust to see the patterns illustrated here in a real world project. For Android, this project also has some improvements: It uses plain JNI instead of the swig library, which, while a bit tedious to write, is better if you want to have more control and understand.
You find instructions to build it in its [wiki](https://github.com/Co-Epi/app-backend-rust/wiki). It also uses classes directly as "payload", instead of the iOS JSON-based API (to be replaced, as JSON is obviously not good for performance demanding communication).

# Android / iOS instructions

Ensure [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) is installed. This includes [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), so you should be able to compile & build Rust projects + install the required targets to build for Android and iOS.

List available targets: 
```
rustup target list
```

Show currently installed targets: 
```
rustup toolchain list
```

The Rust sources are [here](src)

# ![android](img/android1.png) Android instructions

NOTE: For pure JNI (instead of swig) see the real world project: https://github.com/Co-Epi/app-backend-rust/blob/master/src/android/android_interface.rs (Rust), https://github.com/Co-Epi/app-backend-rust/blob/master/android/core/core/src/main/java/org/coepi/core/jni/JniApi.kt (Kotlin).

These steps show how to build and run an Android app in debug mode for a 64 bits emulator. 

See [rust_swig documentation](https://dushistov.github.io/rust_swig/java-android-example.html)


### NDK

Ensure the [NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides) is installed.  

### Environment variables

```
ANDROID_TOOLCHAINS=<Directory where targets should be installed> 
ANDROID_NDK=<NDK's root directory>
```

### Add targets

```
rustup target add x86_64-linux-android
```

### Add path to linker

- Update linker path in [Cargo's config](.cargo/config).

```
[target.x86_64-linux-android]
linker = "<Directory where targets were installed (provided in environment variable)>/android-29-x86_64-4.9/bin/clang"
```

### Build

```
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

### Install

```
./gradlew installDebug
```

### Run

Ensure [adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) is installed. 

then:

```
adb shell am start -n com.schuetz.rust_android_ios/com.schuetz.rust_android_ios.MainActivity
```

OR

Start the app in the emulator / device!

OR 

Run the project in Android Studio. This will build, install and run.

### Relevant configuration files

If you want to add targets or tweak the configuration, you have to edit one or more of these files:

- [App's Gradle config](app/build.gradle): This contains the apk settings (like application id, sdk version) and build steps. It builds for the provided architectures using cargo and puts the generated shared libraries (.so files) in the expected directories. If you want to build for a new target, add it [here](app/build.gradle#L45). The target's key is the [folder name where the shared library will be put](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis.html), and the value is the toolchain's name used by rustup.

- [Cargo config](.cargo/config): Contains linker paths for targets.

- [build.rs](build.rs): This is a script invoked by Cargo before everything else. For Android, it's used to tell [rust_swig](https://github.com/Dushistov/rust_swig) to generate the glue files for Java interop. If you change the app's package structure / names, you have to update this file accordingly. It also sets the import to use for the `NonNull` annotation ( `use_null_annotation_from_package`). If you're using a recent Android SDK version, you don't need to change it.

### Updating Rust

You edited something in Rust! Now you have to:

- Update [java_glue.rs.in](src/java_glue.rs.in) accordingly. This is a file [rust_swig](https://github.com/Dushistov/rust_swig) uses to generate the JNI glue. Consult [rust_swig](https://github.com/Dushistov/rust_swig) docs for syntax. 

- Build, install, run, as described above.

### Updating Kotlin/Java

The code of the Android app can be found [here](app). This is a regular Android app which you can work with normally. Just don't modify the generated JNI files and remember to update [build.rs](build.rs) as described in [Relevant configuration files](#relevant-configuration-files), if you change the package structure.

# ![iOS](img/ios1.png) iOS instructions

### App code

The iOS project is [here](ios_app).

### Add targets
```
rustup target add x86_64-apple-ios
```

### Build & run
From the project's root directory:
```
cargo build --target=x86_64-apple-ios
```
This will generate the required library files: `<project root directory>/target/mobileapp-ios.h` with the C headers and the (static) library for the target, `<project root directory>/target/<target name>/libmobcore.a`. At the moment you have to copy manually libmobcore.a into the iOS app's directory each time you update it.

With the header and library in place, you can run the iOS app. 

### Updating Rust

You edited something in Rust! Now you have to:

- Update the [C glue Rust implementation file](src/ios_c_headers.rs). Orient with the existing code. Differently to Android the glue has to be written manually, because there's no library like rust_swig.

- Build as described in "Build & run". Cargo will invoke build.rs, which uses cbindgen to generate the iOS library files.

- Copy manually the generated `<project root directory>/target/<target name>/libmobcore.a` to the iOS app project's root folder.
 
- Run!

### Updating Swift/ObjC

The code of the iOS app can be found [here](ios_app). This is a regular iOS app which you can work with normally.

# TODO

- Pass / return struct pointers, casting / mapping to iOS structs and Kotlin classes (partly done already for iOS).
- Avoid using global variables in iOS app.
- Automate copying of libmobcore.a or reference properly & multiple targets.
